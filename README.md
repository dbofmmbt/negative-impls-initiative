# {{INITIATIVE_NAME}} initiative
<!--
 This is the template for creating an initiative in rust-lang. Be sure to go
 through all sections marked with `**FIX ME**`, and make sure that the text is
 correct, and feel free to replace/remove any part that's not relevant to
 your group.

 All of the text across all of the initial files uses the same group of
 variables to allow for easy search and replace. They are listed below.

 Example sed command: `sed -i '' 's/{{INITIATIVE_NAME}}/Inline ASM/g' ./**/*.md`
 *Note* the `-i ''` is important as it is required on some platforms e.g. macOS

 * {{INITIATIVE_NAME}} -> The display name of your group e.g. "Inline ASM".
 * {{INITIATIVE_SLUG}} -> The url slug name of your group used for
   `rust-lang/team` and repo name. e.g. "pg-inline-asm".
 * {{CHAT_PLATFORM}} -> The name of your chat app e.g. "Zulip".
 * {{CHAT_LINK}} -> The hyperlink to your discussions on the chat app
   e.g. "https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/216763-project-inline-asm".
